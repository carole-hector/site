            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m a London based recipe developer, where I split my time recipe testing for Helen Goh and developing recipes for a new recipe box start up, Halal Fresh.</p>
            <p>I’m also a food stylist assistant, and have experience assisting on a variety of shoots from still editorials to video commercials. Clients have included: Sainsbury’s, Magazine, Tesco, Schwartz, M&S, Gaggenau, Arla and Delicious Magazine.</p>
            <p>After studying Philosophy and Economics at LSE, I worked as a baker and cake decorator at Lily Vanilli for 1 year. I then went on to study the Three Term Diploma in Food and Wine at Leiths in 2017. I have experience working in professional kitchens and catering companies, and also catering for private clients.</p>
            <p>All recipes on here have been created by myself for personal fun. Happy cooking!</p>
