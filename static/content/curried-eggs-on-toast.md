The flavour of this sandwich is a mixture reminiscent of coronation chicken (minus the chicken) and devilled eggs. Itâ€™s a comforting and familiar taste (as egg sandwiches should be), and although the recipe makes 2 large sandwiches, I suggest greedily making it for yourself and eating without distraction. 

**Makes 2 large sandwiches**   
**Prep time: 10 minutes**    
**Cooking time: 8 minutes**   
 
# Ingredients #

4 slices of bread    
4 eggs    
3 tbsp mayonnaise     
1 tsp curry powder     
1 tsp lime zest     
10ml lime juice     
1-3 tsp mango chutney (depending on how much sweetness you want)     
2 spring onion, finely chopped     
2 tbsp roughly chopped coriander     
Salt, to season    

# Method #

1. Bring a medium saucepan full of water up to the boil, gently place the eggs in the pan and boil for 8 minutes. 
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl add 3 tbsp mayonnaise, 1 tsp curry powder, 1 tsp lime zest, 10ml lime juice and 1-3 tsp mango chutney. Mix together until combined. 
3. Remove the eggs from the water, then run under a cold tap for 15 seconds. Remove the shell from the eggs. Chop the eggs up into small bits, then mix into the mayonnaise bowl and season to taste. Keep in the fridge for up to three days.
