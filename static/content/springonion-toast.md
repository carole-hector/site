Spring onions have a similar flavour to baby leeks (with out the extortionate price tag), and chargrilling them brings out a delicious smoky-sweet flavour. Swap the ricotta for any mild and soft flavoured cheese if you fancy. And use any herbs you have available - basil or mint would work nicely.

# Ingredients #

5 spring onions (small)   
1 large piece of bread    
60g ricotta   
1/2 lemon, zested  
1/4 lemon, juiced 
1 tsp olive oil   
1 tsp hazlenut oil (or normal olive oil)   
A couple of sage leaves, chopped   
Sea salt, to season     


# Method #

1. Heat a griddle pan to almost smoking, then gently place the spring onions on to it. Leave them undisturbed for a couple of minute (to ensure they get nice and even griddle marks), then turn them over and repeat. 

2. Meanwhile toast the bread, and mix together the ricotta, lemon zest, lemon juice and 1 tsp of olive oil, plus salt to season. Spread across the toast.

3. Gently place the spring onions over the ricotta mix, drizzle with 1 tsp of hazelnut oil (or 1 more tsp of olive oil) and sprinkle with some sea salt and the sage leaves. Eat immediately.
