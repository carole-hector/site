Beetroot and horseradish is an undeniable food match since horseradish cuts through the beetrootâ€™s earthiness, and here, the caraway and cumin brings out the beetroot's gentle sweetness. Omit the salsa if you fancy, but it does bring a welcome freshness to the dish. If you want to make this into a meal I would strongly recommend serving it with some smoked mackerel or salmon.

# Ingredients #

250g raw beetroot   
1 tbsp olive oil  
1/2 tbsp caraway seeds  
1 tsp cumin powder  

_For the horseradish yoghurt_  
1 tbsp horseradish cream  
150g thick greek yoghurt  
1 garlic clove, crushed  

_For the salsa_  
1/2 apple, finely diced  
2 tbsp dill, chopped  
2 tbsp capers, chopped  
Sea salt flakes, to season  

# Method #

1. Preheat the oven to 200c/180c fan/gas mark 6.

2. Peel the beetroots then slice them into quarters / eighths, depending on how large they are. Place in a small roasting tin, stir in the oil, then sprinkle them with the caraway seeds, cumin powder and a couple of pinches of salt. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, until the beetroot is cooked through.

3. Meanwhile, mix the greek yoghurt with the horseradish cream and crushed garlic, season to taste. Place in the fridge until ready to use - we want the lovely contrast of fridge cold yoghurt against the hot roasted beetroots.

4. Prepare the salsa by mixing together the apple, dill and capers. Taste and add more of either ingredient as you fancy, plus a little salt if you think it needs
