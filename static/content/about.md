This mushroom soup is homemade and really nice. I made it with ingredients from Chiswick in the summer. The mushrooms are wild and fresh and it goes realy well with white wine. 2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and monospace. Itemized lists
look like:

* this one
* that one
* the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.
