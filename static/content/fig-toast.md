This is not so much a recipe, more a suggestion. I advise you make this when figs are cheap in the shops during late September time. Feel free to omit the truffle and swap around the cheese, blue goes excellently with fig as well. This recipe serves one (often when I cook for myself, it will be something plus toast) - but of course you can scale this recipe up for as many people as you wish. It would make an excellent late summer starter, or can easily be made into canap√©s (just cut up the bread accordingly, and slice rather than quarter the figs). 

**Serves 1**  
**Prep time: 5 minutes**   
  
# Ingredients #

1 fig, quartered  
30g goats cheese (the soft spreadable variety)  
1/4 lemon, zested  
1 tsp truffle honey (or just use normal honey with truffle oil, or normal honey and normal oil)  
1.5 tsp extra virgin olive oil  
1 sprig of thyme, leaves removed  
1 slice of bread, toasted  

# Method #

1. Spread the soft goats cheese over the toasted bread. 

2. Lay over the fig quarters, drizzle over the truffle honey and olive oil, then sprinkle the lemon zest and thyme leaves on top. Serve immediately.
