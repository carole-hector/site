Ideally, this recipe would use dried kidney beans that have been soaked overnight, then cooked for around 45 minutes. I cheat by using canned beans (I’ve always wanted to be the type of person who plans to soak beans overnight, but alas). As a result, this can easily be made midweek. Trini red beans is traditionally served for Sunday lunch, it’s the perfect accompaniment to stew chicken and macaroni pie - but I often just eat it with rice and a side of vegetables.

# Ingredients #

1 can of kidney beans  
1 large onion, chopped  
1 large clove of garlic, finely chopped  
1 tbsp of green seasoning  
200g canned chopped tomatoes (half a can)  

# Method #

1. In a medium sized sauce pan, sweat the onion until sweet and soft, this will take around 10 minutes. Add a pinch of salt - the salt with help draw moisture out of the onion to let it sweat perfectly. 

2. Add the crushed garlic and cook for a couple of minutes.

3. Stir through the green seasoning, canned tomatoes and kidney beans (including the water in the can).

4. Increase the heat and bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 20-25 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together and the sauce to get thicker. Stir every few minutes to prevent it sticking on the bottom.

5. Using a fork or a potato masher, squash some of the beans (I like to mash around half of the beans), then mix until the sauce is evenly combined. Season and serve.
