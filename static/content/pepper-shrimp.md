Pepper shrimp is the love child of Trinidadian’s Chinese ancestry and traditional Trinidadian flavours (thyme, chives, shadon beni, ketchup…). It’s the most delicious homemade shrimp recipe I know - it's sweet, spicy and salty, plus it has the added benefit of actually tasting like a takeaway (with out the immense level of calories or extra money spent).  
  
**Serves 2**
**Prep time: 5 minutes**
**Cooking time: 15 minutes**
  
# Ingredients #

300g shrimp (fresh or frozen) 
1 tbsp cooking oil 
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
2 sprigs thyme, leaves picked and finely chopped 
2-3 tbsp shadon beni (or coriander if shadon beni is not available), finely chopped 
2-3 tbsp chives, finely chopped 
1 tbsp ginger, grated
2 tsp sesame oil
100ml ketchup 
1 large onion, chopped 
1 tbsp soy sauce  
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 pepper, sliced 
Lime juice, to taste (optional)

# Method #

1. Remove the shells from the prawn and devein them. 

2. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat then add the onion and stir frequently until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. 

3. Add the garlic, chilli and ginger and cook for another 2 minutes, to cook out the raw taste of the garlic - it should be slightly golden. 

4. Add the sliced pepper and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent anything from burning. 

5. Add the prawns and cook them through 50% (about 2 minutes), then add the rest of the ingredients (thyme, coriander, chives, sesame oil, ketchup and soy). Let the prawns finish cooking in the sauce, around 2-3 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add a bit of lime juice if you please. Serve with rice.
