Sometimes there's a bad reputation for potato salad in England, but if done well, it's a perfect side dish to BBQs / summer meals. In Trinidad, Potato salad is a classic side dish for nearly any Trini meal, and itâ€™s an essential part of the Sunday table too (along side stew chicken, red beans, macaroni pie, and callaloo). Taste as you go along with this recipe, and a bit more or a bit less of things that take your fancy.
