This victoria soup is homemade and really nice. I made it with ingredients from Chiswick in the summer. The victorias are wild and fresh and it goes realy well with white wine. 2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and monospace. Itemized lists
look like:

* this one
* that one
* the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
