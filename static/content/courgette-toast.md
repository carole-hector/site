A luxurious breakfast, or light dinner - courgette on toast (and all of it’s wonderful variations) is a dish that I often make. It’s quick and cheap, healthy too. I recommend eating this with a soft boiled egg, cooked for 6 minutes in boiling water. Alternatively, a few slices of fried paneer would also be an excellent addition.
