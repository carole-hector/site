  "title": "Roast Beetroot, with Horseradish Yoghurt",
  "description": "Beetroot and horseradish is a great food match since horseradish cuts through the beetrootâ€™s earthiness, and here, the caraway and cumin brings out the beetroot's gentle sweetness. Omit the salsa if you fancy, but it does bring a welcome freshness to the dish. If you want to make this into a meal I would recommend serving it with some smoked mackerel or salmon.",

  "method": [
    "Preheat the oven to 200c/180c fan/gas mark 6.",
    "Peel the beetroots then slice them into quarters / eighths, depending on how large they are. Place in a small roasting tin, stir in 1 tbsp of oil, then sprinkle them with 1/2 tbsp caraway seeds, 1 tsp cumin powder and a couple of pinches of salt. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, until the beetroot is cooked through.",
    "Meanwhile, mix the greek yoghurt with the horseradish cream and crushed garlic, season to taste and place in the fridge until ready to use - we want the lovely contrast of fridge cold yoghurt against the hot roasted beetroots.",
    "Prepare the salsa by mixing together the chopped apple, chopped dill and chopped capers. Taste and add more of either ingredient as you fancy, plus a little salt if you think it needs."
