  "description": "Ideally, this recipe would use dried kidney beans that have been soaked overnight, then cooked for around 45 minutes. I cheat by using canned beans, resulting in a meal that can easily made midweek. Trini red beans is traditionally served for Sunday lunch, itâ€™s the perfect accompaniment to stew chicken and macaroni pie - but I often just eat it with rice and a side of vegetables.",

    "Sweat the onion until sweet and soft, 8-10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the onions catching. In a medium sized sauce pan, sweat the onion until sweet and soft, this will take around 10 minutes. Add a pinch of salt - the salt with help draw moisture out of the onion to let it sweat perfectly.",

    "Using a fork or a potato masher, squash some of the beans (I like to mash around half of the beans), then mix until the sauce is evenly combined. Season and serve. "
