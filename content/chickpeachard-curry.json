  "description": "This curry has the unique combination of a guilty yet wholesome treat - it’s easy enough for a midweek meal, but surprisingly luxurious enough for a special night in. Served with rice it’s the perfect meal in itself. Or buy some peshwari naans from the shop (or your local Indian) as a treat - homemade curry and shop bought naans are one of life’s simple pleasures.",
