  "title": "Carrot, Hazelnut and Caraway Cake",
  "description": "Loaf cakes are one of my favourite things to bake. More often than not, they’re easy and quick to make, but more importantly, the tins are fairly small so I can justify baking something delicious with little worry it will be wasted. This carrot cake is gently spiced and extremely moist from the ground hazelnuts, whilst the freshness from the caraway and carrots makes it taste almost nourishing. If you’re not a fan of caraway (it's an interesting flavour, but often divides people), then feel free to omit it. ",
