  "title": "Cavolo Nero and Chilli Pesto",
  "description": "A traditional pesto is always going to be a undeniable classic, but the quantity of basil that needs to be bought always seem to cost an arm and a leg. And anyway, adding some extra green vegetables into the mix makes it feel a bit more nutritious. Cavolo nero is similar in taste to kale, however itâ€™s slightly less bitter and the leaves are more tender, though feel free to add any green leafy vegetable that you have to hand.",
