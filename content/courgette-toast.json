  "description": "A luxurious breakfast, or light dinner - courgette on toast (and all of it’s wonderful variations) is a dish that I often make. It’s quick, cheap, and very healthy. I recommend eating this with a soft boiled egg (cooked for 6 minutes in boiling water), alternatively, a few slices of fried paneer would also be an excellent addition.",
