  "title": "Fig, Goats Cheese, and Thyme on Toast",
  "description": "This is not so much a recipe, more a suggestion. I advise you make this when figs are cheap in the shops during late September time. Feel free to omit the truffle and swap around the cheese, blue cheese goes excellently with fig as well. This recipe serves one (often when I cook for myself, it will be something plus toast) - but of course you can scale this recipe up for as many people as you wish. It would make an excellent late summer starter, or can easily be made into canap√©s (just cut up the bread accordingly, and slice rather than quarter the figs).",
