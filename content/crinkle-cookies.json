  "description": "A crinkle cookie is basically a brownie and cookie hybrid, the ‘crinkle’ part of the name comes from the beautiful shape the cookie creates as it cooks. Dusted with icing sugar, it’s the perfect thing to bake around the festive period. It also only uses one bowl, making it all the more pleasing to bake.",
