  "title": "Curried Eggs on Toast",
  "description": "The flavour of this sandwich is a mixture reminiscent of coronation chicken and devilled eggs. Itâ€™s a comforting and familiar taste (as egg sandwiches should be), and although the recipe makes 2 large sandwiches, I suggest greedily making it for yourself and eating without distraction.",
